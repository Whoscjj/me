# me

In the quiet moments when the stars align,
A whisper of your name, a longing sign.
I miss you dearly, in every way,
In the gentle breeze and the light of day.

Each passing hour, a reminder true,
Of the moments shared, of me and you.
Your absence felt like a silent plea,
A yearning heart, longing to be free.

In the stillness of nights, when the moon takes flight,
I miss you more than words can write.
The echoes of your laughter, the warmth of your touch,
Are memories I cherish and miss so much.

Through distances vast and oceans wide,
My thoughts of you are a constant tide.
I care about you, more than words express,
In every heartbeat, in every caress.

Your well-being is a flame I tend,
A love that's timeless, an unbroken blend.
In the tapestry of life, you're a thread so rare,
I miss you deeply, I truly care.
